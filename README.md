> a LaTeX lab report template

This repository contains my personal `LaTeX` template that I use to typeset lab reports (most notably for Ms. Pannapara's junior chemistry). I've put it up here because I figured it might be useful to some people.

## usage
You'll likely want a LaTeX environment set up on your computer. I use `texlive` on Debian Linux, but others (like OverLeaf) should work as well.

Refer to the `sample.tex` document for a usage example. If you're using `texlive` or something similar, probably the most pain-free workflow is to simply compile with `pdflatex`, like such:

```
pdflatex sample.tex
```

This should result in a `sample.pdf` file.

## notes
Since this template was originally designed with chemistry in mind, it's mostly based around what Ms. Pannapara expects in her lab reports. If you need additional features, you could contact me, but it'll probably be faster if you implement it yourself.
